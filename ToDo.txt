mme responsibilities:
-select sgw and pgw gateways (CRUD for managing pools)
-keeps tracking areas lists (CRUD for updating lists, maybe different process to handle operations)
-authorizes user (eUtran)
-updates user position



to do:
-figure out how to split concerns (sgw-pgw lists management,area list management, user actions via eUtran)
-would i need a SOA approach based on processes accessing different mnesia tables?

todo2:
replace mnesia with an ETS with a global process
change dictionary with an ETS
